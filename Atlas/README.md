# Kyahidan Atlas

The Atlas will serve to provide a bird eye's view of Kyahida, both political and physical. The maps should be detailed and beautiful: the result of much exacting work from Kyahidan mapmakers. The maps will be suitable 'modern', but stylized in a consistent way.

## Format

There will be a world map whose details are further revealed by large-scale regional maps aided by small-scale maps of particularly interesting areas.

## Generation Approach

I think I can just make a custom vector map with a set 'seed' that creates cousin-kyahida's until I've found one I can live with. Admittedly a high-effort part, I can nonetheless hand-tune the generated stuff with a diff-map that I can hand edit. I can then cover it with gazeteer locations manually.
