# Kyahidan Almanac

The almanac covers a typical year of Kyahida, and reports on the cyclical phenomenon of both the Kyahidan culture as well as its climate. Astrological events, festivals, holidays, memorials, marine migrations, rituals, horoscopes: all these things belong here, in which is essentially a detailed calendar. A few witticisms can happily sneaked in to 'fill space', along with Magazine references.

## Generation Approach

For this, I would create a daily calendar to store notes in. Then I'd go thematically through cyclical events ('what are the holidays?', 'when does algae bloom?', etc) and fill in the year until it was satisfactorily contentful. A standard day-format would probably be the best, and I could potentially 'filter' an underlyingly more detailed almanac for presentational purposes.
