# Kyahidan Magazine

The Magazine portion of the KCP serves as a way for me to publish articles on topics of interest, without committing to full-fledged encyclopedias of particular cultural domains. The Magazine can be written from different in-world perspectives. Articles about any aspect of life, big to small, are appropriate and hopefully will be fun little things to write.

## Format

The Magazine portion is probably the most freeform part of the KCP, so any kind of encyclopedic or pop-writing kind of approach is okay. Main thing is that they need to be a bit shorter, and written in-character (or at least non-omnisciently): something that won't break immersion when the reader peruses.
