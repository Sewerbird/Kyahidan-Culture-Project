# The Kyahidan Culture Project

The Kyahidan Culture Project (KCP) is my personal creative initiative to document, illustrate, and map the fantasy setting of Kyáhida and its people. It is the successor project to The Nendhe, for which I made two roleplaying systems, a handwritten long-form story (Sulerain), and a number of poems and short vignette stories. The idea is to create a worldbook for Kyáhida: an encyclopedia, gazeteer, atlas, and chronicle.

## Goals

Primarily the KCP will achieve two types of goals. The first is to provide an incentive for me to learn new things about climate, paleohistory, geology, astrophysics, and anthropology. The second is to create an actual artifact, namely a physical book of facts and maps that I can share with other people, along with an online form.

### Learning Goals

- Climate Modelling
- Pre-Carboniferous Biology
- Procedural Generation
- Oceanography
- Fishing/Whaling Cultures
- Non-Agricultural Cultures
- Geneology
- Large-Scale Agent Simulation

### Physical Goals

- Hyperlinked Website of Topics
- Gazeteer of 100+ Cities, Locales, and Neighborhoods
- Personal (Programmatically Generated) Histories/Summaries of 100,000's of people
- Atlas of the known world, at 1cm:2.5km
- Chronicle covering major events since Kyahidan civilization began
- Magazine, serving as a survey of current Kyahidan topics (contemporary):
  - Customs
  - Language
  - Spirituality
  - Economics
  - Arts
  - Governance
- (Hardcover?) illustrated guidebook containing all the above. 100-300 pages. (Like a tourist guide book)
