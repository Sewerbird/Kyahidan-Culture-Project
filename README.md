# The Kyahidan Culture Project

The Kyahidan Culture Project (KCP) is my personal creative initiative to document, illustrate, and map the fantasy setting of Kyáhida and its people. It is the successor project to The Nendhe, for which I made two roleplaying systems, a handwritten long-form story (Sulerain), and a number of poems and short vignette stories. The idea is to create a worldbook for Kyáhida: an encyclopedia, gazeteer, atlas, and chronicle.

## Goals

Primarily the KCP will achieve two types of goals. The first is to provide an incentive for me to learn new things about climate, paleohistory, geology, astrophysics, and anthropology. The second is to create an actual artifact, namely a physical book of facts and maps that I can share with other people, along with an online form.
