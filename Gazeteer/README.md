# Kyahidan Gazeteer

The Gazeteer will work in close cooperation with the Atlas, but focus on providing demographic, climatological, and positional information about all the settlements of Kyahida, as well as a section for natural wonders and world records (tallest 10 peaks, etc).

## Format

The demographic section will be tabular, and could essentially be an Excel-kind of data sheet. For locations of particular interest, there can be one-two page spreads highlighting them with a bit of commentary. Similar spreads will describe natural wonders and top-10 lists.

## Generation Approach

Making a list of settlements could happily leverage a computer program which samples distributions and just kind of 'spits out' a bunch of candidate cities. I could then get rid of bad ones and then hand that list over to the atlas for placement. After that, I could hand-tweak the cities based on facts/inspiration gained from finally placing them on the globe. The generator script would hopefully provide enough information to aid in logical placement in the atlas, as well as suggest a road network. Lots of potential for generation exists without having to know exactly where it is.
